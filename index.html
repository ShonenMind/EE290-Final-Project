    <h2>Overview of Project</h2>

    <h4> Project Inspiration : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9024543 </h4>
    <p>
      Millimeter-wave (mmWave) small cell networks play an important role in 5G wireless communication systems. 
      By densely deploying a large number of mmWave small cell base stations (SBSs), thousands of connections 
      and high transmission rates are supported to provide a variety of local services [1], [2]. 
      The SBS provides short-range communications to mobile terminals (MTs) to reduce the propagation loss of 
      signal transmission [3]. With the help of mmWave, multiple SBSs can utilize a large number of antennas 
      to form directional analog beams to MTs and provide concurrent transmissions simultaneously. However, 
      as the number of SBSs and MTs increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to use traditional signal 
      processing methods to improve performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      For our project, we attempt to utilize machine learning (ML) to show a novel ML based method for concurrent tranmission in mmWave small cell networks.

    <p> In the original paper, the authors follow a 3-step process</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
          <strong>1. Random Distribution Modeling:</strong> 
          The large random distribution of SBSs is modeled by a heterogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), 
          where the average sum rate (ASR) of MT under concurrent transmission can be obtained.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>2. Machine Learning for Beam Selection:</strong> 
          Downlink SBS conditions are established as a large database for machine learning training. An iterative 
          support vector machine (SVM) classifier is proposed for analog beam selection of each SBS.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>3. Iterative SMO Algorithm:</strong> 
          An iterative sequential minimal optimization (SMO) training algorithm is proposed, enabling SBSs to perform 
          highly efficient and low-complexity analog beam selection during concurrent transmissions.
      </li>
  </ul>
